    to organize a network of shelter employees, volunteers, and resource providers;

    We are a team of web developers, data scientists, researchers, and educators
    passionate about solving the problem of homelessness in Portland, Oregon.
    <br />
    <br />
    <ul>
      <li>Displays, on all cellphones, a comprehensive list of Portland’s shelter, food, clothing and medical resources, and, for those with smartphone access, maps them in relation to a user's location. Also on this map, users can easily check bed availability at shelters, a feature that updates in real time.</li>
      <br>
      <li> Enables shelters at capacity to check neighboring shelters simultaneously for backup relief, as well as send out push notifications to an extended family of aid workers and volunteers. Resource requests display on our platform’s live feed— along with other pertinent updates— enabling responders to combine forces and improvise resource deliveries.</li>
      <br>
      <li> Streamlines intake processes at understaffed shelters, so providers can spend less time checking guests in and more time developing caring, trusting relationships.</li>
      <br>
      <li> Tracks resource requests and deliveries, providing a broader statistical picture of homelessness in the Portland metro area. We know far more about the people inside shelters than we do about those left out of them. Helping those on the fringes will provide a more comprehensive understanding of homelessness in our community.</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    We are creating a nexus of communication shared by shelters, aid workers, volunteers, and people who need relief. When people know how many opportunities there are to give and receive, it will in turn inspire them to help and ask for help.
